TO DO & IDEAS

[X] use less-random by default. rename to fast-random.cd
[x] Add changelog

Rdoc

Add save & resume. So i can scn 1000, do somthing, repeat, etc.
Catch ^C and save in current directory

bundle with script to resolve with whatever resolvers are on the box.
adns, apache log resovler, etc.

optionally log each usage with a HTTP GET /track/geoipgen?cmdline=&uname=

Output information about the target country. Number of ip addresses, etc.

Generate IP ranges, random, or ordered and with an offset

Check if usage -c is the whole file or just DIR

no writing files option, useful when without a writable home dir. slower start up times

detect when writable homedir not available and use 'no writing files' option. eg. www-data user can't write to it's homedir

Output all but specified countries -- need two maps, take adding to map out of loading country. produce from world map, 
suppress intersection with cc map

Maybe use ip lists as sets - intersect, union, subtraction
 
User defined sets - either defined by line or by file. example input
files can be any line with 2 ip's where 1 is lwoer than the next

Make win32 EXE version

separate IP generator library
